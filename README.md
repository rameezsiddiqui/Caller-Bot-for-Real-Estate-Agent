### Caller Bot for Real Estate Agents

This bot is for real estate agents who need a tool to automatically call all the numbers listed in a Google Sheet, saving them valuable time and effort.

There are two separate sheets the bot pulls numbers from, each tied to a specific purpose and corresponding pre-recorded message:

#### 1. **Details for an Updated Accurate Evaluation**

**Sheet #1** contains contacts for property owners who may benefit from an updated, accurate property evaluation.

**Recording Message:**

> "Hey, this is John Hill calling from Retail Investment Group. I saw you are an owner of retail property. The reason I’m calling is I thought you might want an updated, accurate evaluation of your property—free of charge. If you could return my call at  **541-213-9338** , once again, that’s  **541-213-9338** . Or you can also text 'interested'."

#### 2. **Details to Reach Out to Similar Property Owners**

**Sheet #2** includes numbers of property owners with similar property types, like Denny’s.

**Recording Message:**

> "Hi, my name is John Hill calling from Retail Investment Group. I saw that you are the owner of a Denny's property. The reason I’m calling is we just sold a Denny’s property in Glendale, Arizona. I like to reach out to similar property owners to let them know that this property has been sold. I also thought you might want an updated, accurate evaluation of your property—free of charge. If you could please return my call at  **541-213-9338** , once again, that’s  **541-213-9338** . Or you can also text 'interested'."
